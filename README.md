# PRASUNET_ML_05

## Problem Statement

### Background
- In today's fast-paced world, maintaining a healthy diet is a significant challenge for many individuals. Accurate dietary tracking is essential for weight management, disease prevention, and overall well-being. However, manual logging of food items and their calorie content can be tedious, time-consuming, and prone to errors. There is a need for an automated system that can simplify this process by recognizing food items from images and estimating their calorie content accurately.

### Objective
- The objective of this project is to develop a machine learning model that can:

- <u>Recognize Food Items from Images</u> : Accurately identify a wide variety of food items from photographs taken by users.
- <u>Estimate Calorie Content</u> : Provide an accurate estimate of the calorie content for the recognized food items.

## About the Dataset üìä

- Download the dataset from here: [Dataset Download](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/dansbecker/food-101/data)

- It contains images of food, organized by type of food. It was used in the Paper "Food-101 ‚Äì Mining Discriminative Components with Random Forests" by Lukas Bossard, Matthieu Guillaumin and Luc Van Gool. It's a good (large dataset) for testing computer vision techniques.

- This Dataset contains 101 types of food, each category having 1000 images.
